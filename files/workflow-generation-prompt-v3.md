# Workflow Generation Prompt

Convert user's process description into two tables: Elements and Connections. Use semantic analysis to interpret what the user expects the flow to contain. Extend where required but always maintain the structure described.

## Table 1: Elements

| Column | Values | Required | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| element_id | Unique string | YES | E.g., START_001, PROC_001, DEC_001, ACT_001, END_001 |
| element_name | Any text | YES | Display name |
| element_type | start, end, user_action_process, system_decision, system_action | YES | Box type |
| lock_keyword | lock_noterasable, lock_noteditable | For user_action_process only | lock_noterasable = cannot delete but may edit it or subprocesses within anyhow; lock_noteditable = fully locked |
| user_assigned | Role/user name | For user_action_process only | Who performs this |
| comment_text | Any text | NO | System background actions for this stage (auto-fill, calculations, notifications, etc.) |
| text_below | Any text | NO | Optional label |
| parent | element_id | NO | E.g. PROC_001

**Element types:**
- start: Workflow beginning. No lock/user.
- end: Workflow completion. After the e.g. closed form state. Terminal point — not a form state but after one
- user_action_process: ONLY when a human User actively performs an action on a form (fills, reviews, approves, submits). Requires lock_keyword + user_assigned. A finalized/closed form is itself a user_action_process with an outbound connection to end — never model it as end directly.
- system_decision: Diamond shape. Only when it is not User action - system checks condition and routes to ONE OF MULTIPLE paths. MUST have at least 2 outgoing conditional connections with different condition values. No lock/user.
- system_action: Parallelogram shape. System performs a single background action (auto-assign, auto-fill, send notification, add record). Has exactly ONE outgoing connection with connection_type: normal. Action description goes in comment_text. No lock/user.

## Table 2: Connections

Each row = one arrow between elements.

| Column | Values | Required | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| connection_id | Unique string | YES | E.g., CONN_001 |
| source_element_id | element_id | YES | Arrow starts here |
| target_element_id | element_id | YES | Arrow points here |
| condition | Text | For system_decision paths | E.g., "Tak", "Approved", "Senior Manager" |
| connection_type | normal, conditional | YES | "conditional" for system_decision outgoing paths |
| button | Text | NO | Button label triggering transition |
| validation | Text | NO | Validation rule checked before transition |
| trigger | time, button, await | YES | How transition happens |

**Triggers:**
- button: User clicks a button (button text required)
- time: Automatic after time period
- await: System/external trigger, no user action

## Rules

- user_action_process elements need lock_keyword + user_assigned
- parent is used to define subprocess that starts and ends within PROC, every actions that is performed within the PROC element will use standard elements workflow, many subprocesses may exist in PROC, PROC is in most cases form with some data, actions like generation of new records within tables, redirections are treated as internal PROC subprocesses
- every subprocesses identified has to have within PROC created a new START and END point, their parent is the PROC
- connections between PROC and subprocess cannot exist; connections related to subprocess exist only from start of subprocess till end of subprocess
- start / end / system_decision / system_action elements do NOT need lock_keyword or user_assigned
- All IDs must be unique
- system_decision: MINIMUM 2 outgoing connections, all conditional, each with a different condition value
- system_action: exactly 1 outgoing connection, connection_type: normal
- **element_type must be exactly one of: start, end, user_action_process, system_decision, system_action. No other values exist.**
- **Returning to an existing stage is NEVER a new element — draw a direct arrow back to the existing element. If something returns to existing element - make sure not new User process is created**
- **Last action like closing form is User_action_process because reflects the last state of form; is followed by end marker**
- system_decision and system_action elements that sit on the transition path between two user_action_process stages belong in the main diagram — they are not internal to a stage.
- **system_decision is system check, not User action. User performs its decision by clicking buttons, systems checks appear when system verifies data**
- **User decision in main diagram - User action process - is always resolved as button in that User action process, do not create additional decision boxes when button defines action performed**
- A closed/finalized form is a user_action_process (a form state), not an end — it has its own outbound connection to a blank end element that marks only the termination of the workflow.
- Actions that happen entirely within one form state and do not lead to any other element are internal subprocesses — they must not appear as elements or connections in the diagram.

## Ignore

Ignore form fields, notifications, data structures, UI details, integrations. Focus only on: stages, users, connections, transitions.

## Format example only

**Input:** "Operator fills invoice form, selects approver, clicks 'Send for approval' (validates approver selected). System checks if approver is Senior Ma(...)"

**Elements:**

```elements.csv
element_id,element_name,element_type,lock_keyword,user_assigned,comment_text,text_below
START_001,Start,start,,,,
PROC_001,Wprowadzenie danych faktury,user_action_process,lock_noterasable,Operator,,
```

**Connections:**

```connections.csv
connection_id,source_element_id,target_element_id,condition,connection_type,button,validation,trigger
CONN_001,START_001,PROC_001,,normal,,,await
CONN_002,PROC_001,DEC_001,,normal,Wyślij do akceptacji,Approver wskazany,button
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT — MANDATORY

Respond with exactly two sections:

**1. Markdown tables for review** — print both tables in readable markdown format.

**2. Downloadable CSV files** — output as two raw CSV code blocks labeled `elements.csv` and `connections.csv`:

```elements.csv
element_id,element_name,element_type,lock_keyword,user_assigned,comment_text,text_below
...
```

```connections.csv
connection_id,source_element_id,target_element_id,condition,connection_type,button,validation,trigger
...
```

Values containing commas must be wrapped in double quotes.
